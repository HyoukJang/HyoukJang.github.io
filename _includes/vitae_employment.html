            an indoor light source to find the 3-dimensional location and posture of objects. The
            core technology uses a small polarizing filter to be attached to any indoor lighting(POLAR) and a
            small sensor ‘ANT’ that receives the angle and distance data from the sensed
            light. It enable to make self-driving AGV(Automated Guided Vehicles) in smart factory, smart parking system which includes optimal path navigation for cars.
